# ABOUT PROJECT

M&I is a web application that allows an influencer or a brand to create an account, log in after signing up, and access the dashboard in order to:

## EDIT PROFILE

M&I allows an influencer or a brand to edit some information of the profile or all of them, save the changes, and also have the possibility to send a request to delete their account to the platform admin.

## SEARCH MESSAGES

M&I allows an influencer to search existing brand discussions in order to continue the discussion with them via the chat interface. Similarly, brands can search for existing influencer discussions to continue the conversation.

## CREATE PARTNERSHIP

M&I allows an influencer to create a new offer with a brand after discussing the possibility of establishing a partnership. A confirmation request (accepting or rejecting) will be sent to the brand. The influencer or the brand can edit the content of the contract before confirmation. The same procedure applies when a brand initiates a partnership with an influencer.

## SEARCH CONTACTS

M&I allows an influencer to find all available registered brands in order to chat with them. Similarly, brands can find all available registered influencers on M&I's platform.

### ADMIN

Admin access is protected for security reasons, and new admins can only be added via phpMyAdmin. The admin has the ability to search for all available registered influencers and brands (with the option to contact or delete the account), check all deletion requests from influencers or brands, review confirmed offers and partnerships, and also edit profile information.
